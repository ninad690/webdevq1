I have created a wweather site called Cloudnow.
this is just the frontend as i couldnt figure out how to integrate an api inside.
i created the navbar which has the logo and its symbol . i used the span attribute to colour the logo and resized the image which i brought from google.
i added 3 more items in the navbar which i formatted to include a hover effect. 
next i added a background image and wrote what the webite is based on.
for the api part i added a search bar and a submit button which would take the input for location..
2 more containers are created where the api will appear once integrated.

as i was unaware of the format for writting css i checked my errors using chatgpt.but the code is written by me entirely.
